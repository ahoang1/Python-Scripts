Project Name: FinalProject.py

Description: The purpose of this Python script is to retrieve a FASTA file and introduce random mutations into the nucleotide sequence.
Following the random mutation generator, percentage of base composition is compared and pairwise alignment is performed to observe where the mutations occurred.

Installation: Software required - Python 2.7
Downlad this .py file to your Computer. It is IMPORTANT to save the .py file and the .fasta file within the same folder.

Usage: This python script can be used to observe how pairwise alignment works.
Can also be further manipulated to introduce clinical pathogenic variants
