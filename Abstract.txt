#Final Project Abstract

The purpose of this project was to create a script that can be utilized for research purposes regarding the study of genetic variation.
First, the script would retrieve a FASTA file containing a nucleotide sequence.
Next, the original sequence will be randomly mutated and the base compositions will be compared.
Finally, the sequences will be aligned using pairwise alignment. 
This script serves as a stepping stone for more complex studies in which clinically relevant mutations can be computed and observed.
